   UsosAPI instance.
2. Enter:
    Application Name = USOS2google
    Application's Webpage = https://github.com/mdebski/usos2google
   and your email.
3. Click 'Submit' and copy Consumer key and Consumer secret to
   corresponding variables in usos2google_conf.py file.
4. Run usos2google, enter site you will be asked to and copy PIN from it.
5. To avoid repeating 4. point every time you run usos2google, you may copy
   Access Token Key i Access Token Secret to usos2google_conf.py

Google authorization is performed simply with your password - you will be asked
for it every time.
